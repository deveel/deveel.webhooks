# Deveel Webhooks

[![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/deveel/deveel.webhooks/actions/workflows/cd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/deveel/deveel.webhooks/actions/workflows/cd.yml) [![Code Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/deveel/deveel.webhooks/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=BKRX2N1IZ1)](https://codecov.io/gh/deveel/deveel.webhooks)

This project provides a set of .NET tools for the management of subscriptions to events, basic transformations and notifications of such event occurrences (_webhooks_): in a global design scope, this model enables event-driven architectures, triggering system processes upon the occurrence of expected occurrences from other systems.

Although this integration model is widely adopted by major service providers (like _[SendGrid](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/tracking-events/getting-started-event-webhook)_, _[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/webhooks)_, _[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks)_, _[Slack](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)_, etc.), there is no formal protocol or authority that would enforce a compliance (like for other cases, such as OpenID, OpenAPI, etc.).

Anyway, a typical implementation consists of the following elements:

* Webhooks are transported through _HTTP POST_ callbacks
* The webhook payload is represented as a JSON object
* The webhook payload includes properties that describe the type of event and the time-stamp of the occurrence
* An optional signature in the header of the request or a query-string parameter ensures the authenticity of the caller

## Motivation

While working on a .NET Core 3.1/.NET 5 *aaS (_as-a-Service_) project that functionally required the capability of users of the service being able to create system-to-system subscriptions and notifications (typically named _webhooks_), I started my design with the ambition to use existing solutions, to avoid the bad practice of _reinventing the wheel_, but I ended up frustrated in such ambition:

* [Microsoft's ASP.NET Webhooks](https://github.com/aspnet/WebHooks) project was archived and moved back to the [Microsoft ASP Labs](https://github.com/aspnet/AspLabs), not providing any visibility on its status, and not being compatible with .NET Core (and even less with the stack .NET 5/6)
* Even in its _experimental_ status, the **Microsoft ASP.NET Webhooks** framework removed the capability of handling subscriptions, being mainly focused on _receivers_
* Alternative implementations were included and organic part of frameworks (like [ASP.NET Boilerplate](https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate)), that would have forced me to adopt the the entirety of such frameworks, beyond my design intentions

## Usage Documentation

You can refer to the [Documentation](docs/README.md) provided to getting you started using the framework, and eventually extending it.
