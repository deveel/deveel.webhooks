This project provides a set of .NET tools for the management of subscriptions to events, basic transformations and notifications of such event occurrences (_[webhooks](docs/concept_webhook.md)_): in a global design scope, this model enables event-driven architectures, triggering system processes upon the occurrence of expected occurrences from other systems.

Although this integration model is widely adopted by major service providers (like _[SendGrid](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/tracking-events/getting-started-event-webhook)_, _[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/webhooks)_, _[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks)_, _[Slack](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)_, etc.), there is no formal protocol or authority that would enforce a compliance (like for other cases, such as OpenID, OpenAPI, etc.).

Anyway, a typical implementation consists of the following elements:

* Webhooks are transported through _HTTP POST_ callbacks
* The webhook payload is formatted as a JSON object (or alternatively, in lesser common scenarios, as XML or Form)
* The webhook payload includes properties that describe the type of event and the time-stamp of the occurrence
* An optional signature in the header of the request or a query-string parameter ensures the authenticity of the caller

I tried to express the concepts in more details in [this page](docs/concept_webhook.md) within this repository (without any ambition to be pedagogic).

## Motivation

While working on a .NET Core 3.1/.NET 5 *aaS (_as-a-Service_) project that functionally required the capability of users of the service being able to create system-to-system subscriptions and notifications of events through HTTP channel (that is typically named _webhooks_, or _HTTP callbacks_), I started my design with the ambition to use existing solutions, to avoid the bad practice of _reinventing the wheel_, but I ended up frustrated in such ambition:

* [Microsoft's ASP.NET Webhooks](https://github.com/aspnet/WebHooks) project was archived and moved back to the [Microsoft ASP Labs](https://github.com/aspnet/AspLabs/tree/main/src/WebHooks) (that has no visibility on its release), aiming one day to provide compatibility with .NET Core (which eventually evolved, becoming LTS)
* Both Microsoft's projects (the _legacy_ and the _experimental_ ones) are not compatible with the latest .NET stacks (_.NET 5_ / _.NET 6_)
* Microsoft's _experimental_ projects never implemented any capability of handling subscriptions, and eventually removing also the _sender_ capability, focusing exclusively on _receivers_
* Alternative implementations providing similar capabilities are embedded and organic part of larger frameworks (like [ASP.NET Boilerplate](https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate)), that would have forced me to adopt the the entirety of such frameworks, beyond my design intentions

## Usage Documentation

We would like to help you getting started with this framework and to eventually extend it: please refer to the [Documentation](docs/README.md) section that we have produced for you.

The easiest way to get started is to follow the [Quick Start](docs/QUICKSTART.md) guide, but you can also refer to the [Frequently Asked Questions](docs/FAQS.md) section to get answers to the most common questions.

## A Simple Example

The following example shows how to create a webhook subscription, and how to send a notification to the subscribed endpoint:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;

using Deveel.Webhooks;

namespace Example {
	public class Program {
		public static void Main(string[] args) {
			var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
			
			// configure your other services ...

			// ... and then configure the webhooks
			builder.Services.AddWebhooks(webhooks => {
				webhooks.AddSubscriptions<MongoWebhookSubscription>(subs => {
					subs.UseMongoDb("mongodb://localhost:27017")
						.UseSubscriptionResolver();
				});

				webhooks.AddNotifier<MyWebhook>(notifier => {
					notifier.UseSender(sender => {
						sender.Configure(options => {
							options.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);
						});
					});
				});
			});

			var app = builder.Build();

			// configure your other middlewares ...

			// ... and then configure the webhooks
			// to manually send the webhooks ...
			app.MapPost("/webhooks", async (HttpContext context, 
				[FromServices] IWebhookSender<MyWebhook> sender, [FromBody] MyWebhookModel webhook) => {
				var destination = webhook.Destination.ToWebhookDestination();
				var result = await sender.SendAsync(destination webhook, context.HttpContext.RequestAborted);

				// you can log the result of the delivery ...

				return Results.Ok();
			});

			// ... or notify the webhooks automatically from subscriptions
			app.MapPost("/webhooks/notify", async (HttpContext context, 
				[FromServices] IWebhookNotifier<MyWebhook> notifier, [FromBody] MyEventModel eventModel) => {
				var eventInfo = eventModel.AsEventInfo();
				var result = await notifier.NotifyAsync(eventInfo, context.HttpContext.RequestAborted);

				// you can log the result of the notification to all receivers ...
				return Results.Ok();
			});

			app.Run();
		}
	}
}
```

More examples are available in the [Examples](examples/README.md) section.
