# Deveel Webhooks Documentation

Here you can find a documentation of the `Deveel Webhooks` framework, to help you getting started with the libraries and functions that compose it and to understand how it works.


## Basic Concepts

To set the domain model of the framework, we need to introduce some basic concepts that are used in the framework.

| Topic                                                | Description                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **[Webhook](concept_webhook.md)**                    | What is it a 'Webhook' and why I need it?  |
| **[Subscriptions](concept_webhook_subscription.md)** | How does a subscription to an event works? |
| **[Senders](concept_webhook_sender.md)**             | What is a sender of webooks?               |
| **[Receivers](concept_webhook_receiver.md)**         | What is a receiver of webooks?             |
| **[Notifications](concept_webhook_notification.md)** | What is a notification of events?         |

## Basic Usage

The following tutorials will guide you through the basic usage of the framework, showing how to use the different components to send, receive and manage webhooks.

| Topic                                                    | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Getting Started](getting_started.md)**                | Getting started with `Deveel Webhooks`                                |
| **[Sending Webhooks](basic_usage_send.md)**              | Manually sending webhooks (no subscriptions)                          |

## Advanced Usage

A more advanced usage of the framework is possible by implementing custom components that can be used to extend the framework functionalities.

| Topic                                                             | Description                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Filtering Subscriptions](advanced_usage_filters.md)**          | Allow subscribers to filter webhooks on dynamic parameters                               |
| **[Custom Data Factories](advanced_usage_custom_datafactory.md)** | Implement a component that transforms event data                                         |

| **[Using Entity Framework Data Layers](advanced_usage_ef.md)**    | Use the Entity Framework data layer for the persistence of the webhook information model |

## Receivers

The framework provides a set of libraries that can be used to receive webhooks from external sources.

| Receiver                             | Description                                        |
