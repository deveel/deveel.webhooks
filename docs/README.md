# Deveel Webhooks

Here you can find documentation of the `Deveel Webhooks` framework, to help you get started with the libraries and functions that compose it and to understand how it works.

## Introduction

The framework is composed of a set of libraries that can be used, at different degrees, to implement a system that allows applications to send and receive webhooks.

* **Sending Webhooks** - Using libraries of the framework you can send webhooks to receivers, based on your own logic and rules.
* **Receiving Webhooks** - The framework provides a set of libraries implementing the capabilities for receiving webhooks from senders and reacting to events from external systems (such as Twilio, SendGrid, Facebook, etc.).
* **Notifications** - The framework provides a set of libraries that can be used to manage subscriptions to events and notify subscribing applications of events that occurred in your system.
