# Webhook Subscription Management

The process of sending _webhooks_ to recipient \[systems\] is provided through implementations of the `IWebhookSender` contract, and in the model provided by _Deveel Webhooks_ is not dependent from the existence of a Subscription Management component: that means you might implement your own components for the Webhook Subscription Management (see the section on _[Advanced Usage - Custom Webhook Management](advaned_usage_custom_management.md)), using the remaining parts of the framework.

Anyway the framework provides a default implementation for the management and resolution of subscriptions to certain type of events, and optionally other additional conditions (_subscription filters_), to ease the process of notification.

## Service Instrumentation

Assuming you are working on a traditional _[ASP.NET application model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=windows)_, you can start using the management functions of this framework through the _Dependency Injection_ (DI) pattern, including the base implementations during the Startup of your application, calling the `.AddWebhooks()` extension method provided by _Deveel Webhooks_:

``` csharp
using System;

using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

using Deveel.Webhooks;

namespace Example {
    public class Startup {
        public Startup(IConfiguration config) {
            Configuration = config;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        public void Configure(IServiceCollection services) {
            // ... add any other service you need ...

            // this call adds the basic services for sending of webhooks
            services.AddWebhooks(webhooks => {
                // with this we include the subscription management services
                webhooks.UseSubscriptionManager();

                // for this implementation we use a Mongo database as
                // persistent layer of the subscriptions
                wekhooks.UseMongoDb(mongo => {
                    mongo.SetConnectionString(Configuration
                         .GetConnectionString("MongoWebhooks"))
                         .SetDatabase("example_app")
                         .SetSubscriptionsCollection("webhook_subs");
                });
            });
        }
    }
}

```

## Using the Mnagement Service

You can proceed by creating a new API controller and name it `WebhookSubscriptionController`, specifying one of the arguments of type `IWebhookSubscriptionManager` in the constructor>

``` csharp
using System;

using Deveel.Webhooks;

using Example.WebModels;

namespace Example {
    [ApiController]
    [Route("webhook/subscription")]
    public class WebhookSubscriptionController : ControllerBase {
        private readonly IWebhookSubscriptionManager subscriptionManager;

        public WebhookSubscriptionController(IWebhookSubscriptionManager subscriptionManager) {
            this.subscriptionManager = subscriptionManager;
        }

        [HttpPost("{tenantId}")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Post([FromRoute]string tenantId, [FromBody] WebhookSubscriptionModel subscription) {
            // we need a WebhookSubscriptionInfo object to create a webhook subscription,
            // and this implementation assumes that your web model WebhookSubscriptionModel
            // provides a method to create one instance of it
            var subscriptionInfo = subscription.AsSubscriptionInfo();

            // The system is natively multi-tenant, that means an identifier of the owning
            // tenant of the subscriptions is needed (in future versions it might be an optional capability)
            var result = await subscriptionManager.CreateAsync(tenantId, subscriptionInfo, HttpContext.RequestAborted);

            // The result of a successfull creation is a IWebhookSubscription instance, that
            // you need to convert to an ASP.NET serializable model...
            var resultModel = WebhookSubscriptionModel.FromSubscription(result);

            // In this implementation we respond with a 201 code, the location of the GET /webhook/subscription/{tenantId}/{subscriptionId}
            // and the subscription object just created
            return CreatedAtAction("Get", new { tenantId, id = result.SubscriptionId }, resultModel);
        }

        [HttpGet("{tenantId}/{id}")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Get([FromRoute]string tenantId, [FromRoute] string id) {
            var subscription = await subscriptionManager.GetAsync(tenantId, id, HttpContext.RequestAborted);

            if (subscription == null)
                return NotFound();

            // The returned object is a IWebhookSubscription instance, that
            // you need to convert to an ASP.NET serializable model...
            var resultModel = WebhookSubscriptionModel.FromSubscription(subscription);

            return Ok(resultModel);
        }
    }
}

```

**Note**: The `IWebhookSubscriptionManager` contract provides more functions (for paginated lists, updates, deletions, state changing, etc.), not displayed in this simple example.
