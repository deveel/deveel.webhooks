# What is a Receiver of Webhooks?

As we have cleared out before, Webhooks are messages that inform an application of the occurrence of an event in a system: as such we consider the context of communications, where there are two (or more) parties sending and receiving messages between each other.

In a specular way to the definition of the Webhook Sender, of which we made an analogy with a postman delivering a letter or a package, the Webhook Receiver can be considered the recipient (a person or a company), that physically receives the deliverable.

Considering the real-life scenario of delivery of letters or packages, we all can be receivers, if we provide a postbox with our name on it, that we make available for postmen to access.&#x20;

In some special cases of secure shipments, we might also be requested to sign a receipt to ensure that the packages or envelopes were actually delivered.
